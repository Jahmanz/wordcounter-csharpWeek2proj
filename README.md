  * For example: "A" should be 1 word, and "at" should count as 2.

* Next, make sure it doesn't include symbols.
  * For example: "I'm" should come out as 2 words.

* Next, see if it can count the single letters.
  * For example, "dog" should output 1 d, 1 o, and 1 g.

* Next, see if it can count words with multiple same letters.
  * "Mississippi could come out as 1 M, 4 i's, 4 s's, and 2 p's.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
